# Starter plugin for WordPress and Gutenberg, the new editor!

**Todo: write the readme file ;-)**

While you are waiting for me to write the readme file, open a terminal and enter below command :

`npm install`

Waiting for the installation of dependencies<br>And... You can start to develop!

`npm run dev`

Have fun :-)
